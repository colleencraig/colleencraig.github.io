Richard Gunther is professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University. In addition to over 100 scholarly articles, monographs and book chapters, Gunther is author or editor of 15 books, most of them dealing with political parties, electoral behavior, and transitions to democratic rule.  He is the international co-coordinator of the Comparative National Elections Project which, to date, has undertaken 60 national election surveys in 33 countries.

Gunther has been active in redistricting reform efforts since 2005.  He is co-author of the amendments to the Ohio Constitution (approved by over 71% of Ohio’s voters in November 2015) which will constrain or end partisan gerrymandering of the Ohio General Assembly, and one of the larger team that negotiated the reform of Congressional redistricting that was ratified by 75% of the voters in 2018.
