          <p>If passed, these unity maps would mark the first time where we have actual, realistic maps that reflect how Ohioans vote - not maps that have been gerrymandered to privilege a certain political majority. </p>

          <p>Fair, representative maps must reflect how Ohioans actually vote. Over the last decade, Ohio Republicans have only captured about 55% of the statewide vote. Ohio Republicans currently hold supermajorities at the Statehouse, but they are not winning supermajorities of the statewide vote. That’s not fair or reasonable.</p>
            
          <p>At the state legislative level, maps must include at least 44 Democratic House seats (out of 99 seats) and 14 Democratic Senate seats (out of 33 seats).</p>
            
          <p>Ohioans want a transparent process we can trust, where communities remain whole and where voters’ representational power has been diluted by “packing and cracking,” especially Black voters. Our commission’s proposed map recommends 12 Minority Opportunity Districts for the Ohio House and 4 Minority Opportunity Districts for the Senate, meaning they have a Black Voting Age Population of at least 30%. Two additional seats are within 2% of the minority opportunity threshold.If passed, these unity maps would mark the first time where we have actual, realistic maps that reflect how Ohioans vote - not maps that have been gerrymandered to privilege a certain political majority. </p>
