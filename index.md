# About the Ohio Citizens’ Redistricting Commission 

The Ohio Citizens’ Redistricting Commission (OCRC) is an independent, nonpartisan commission made up of 15 volunteer members. Commission members include academics, former elected officials, community representatives, and other individual citizens from across the state. 

The commission’s work includes: 

1. Hosting public hearings for community input
2. Collecting publicly available data for map-making
3. Supporting public education on redistricting. 

This commission’s work will culminate in a report containing recommendations and unity maps based on the testimony and community maps we gather from citizens across the state, which we shall then submit as public testimony in Ohio’s official redistricting process.

The Commission is co-sponsored by the Ohio Organizing Collaborative (OOC), Ohio Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the A. Philip Randolph Institute (APRI) of Ohio. The Commission will partner with the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at The Ohio State University and MGGG Redistricting Lab at Tufts University for data collection, analysis and community mapping.
