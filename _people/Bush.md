Dr. Ellen Greene Bush lives on Catawba Island in Port Clinton on Ohio’s wonderful natural resource, Lake Erie.  The health of our water, and the 2014 water crisis in Northwest Ohio, was the compelling reason for her jumping into volunteer work after retirement.  

She is a member of the League of Women’s Voters, a supporter of the Ohio Environmental Council and the Matriots, and a leader of American Promise Ohio.  

She has a PhD in Clinical Psychology from Bowling Green State University and a MS in Nursing from The Ohio State University.
