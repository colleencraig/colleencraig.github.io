We want to hear from you! You can attend a public hearing or submit testimony to the commission. You can use mapping software to draw communities of interest, try your hand at redistricting Ohio yourself, or visit our community of interest event page to tell us about your community.

To learn more about how to draw a Community Map using the Ohio District tool, go to the testimony portal and scroll down to the instructional videos.

To give testimony at one of our public hearings on Zoom, submit your testimony to the portal and then email your request and written remarks to [info@commissionocrc.org](mailto:info@commissionocrc.org) at least 24 hours in advance of the hearing you want to testify at.
