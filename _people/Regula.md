Dr. Regula is a lecturer in biology at the University of Dayton, where he teaches Human Anatomy and other undergraduate classes. Since earning his doctorate from Kent State University in 2013, he has taught at a wide range of courses at both public and private colleges, while continuing his involvement in community service. Dr. Regula's research and advocacy revolve around intersections- whether that's the intersection of members of an ecological community, or intersections of the natural and built environment, or intersecting identities in the fight for social justice.
