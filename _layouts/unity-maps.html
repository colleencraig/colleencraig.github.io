          <p>If passed, these unity maps would mark the first time where we have actual, realistic maps that reflect how Ohioans vote - not maps that have been gerrymandered to privilege a certain political majority. </p>

          <p>Fair, representative maps must reflect how Ohioans actually vote. Over the last decade, Ohio Republicans have only captured about 55% of the statewide vote. Ohio Republicans currently hold supermajorities at the Statehouse, but they are not winning supermajorities of the statewide vote. That’s not fair or reasonable.</p>
            
          <p>At the state legislative level, maps must include at least 44 Democratic House seats (out of 99 seats) and 15 Democratic Senate seats (out of 33 seats).</p>
            
          <p>Ohioans want a transparent process we can trust, where communities remain whole and where voters’ representational power hasn't been diluted by “packing and cracking,” especially Black voters.</p>
            
          <p>The Commission reviewed proposed maps to ensure that minority voters were fairly represented. The proposed map has 15 districts in the Ohio House and 6 districts in the Ohio Senate where Black voters have a substantial opportunity to be represented electorally.</p>
